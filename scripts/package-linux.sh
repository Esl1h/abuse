# The build dependencies, by distribution. SDL3 comes from the distribution
# where it has one; SDL3_mixer never does, so it is built from source and
# installed beside the game, and these are the codec libraries it looks for.
# Debian 13 ships SDL3 3.2, older than the 3.4 the pinned SDL3_mixer needs,
# so CPM builds SDL3 from source there and every one of SDL3's own build
# dependencies has to be here. Leaving one out does not disable a feature:
# SDL treats a missing dependency for an enabled subsystem as an error.
# file and dpkg-dev are for CPack itself: it shells out to dpkg-shlibdeps
# to work out the dependencies, and refuses to start without `file`.
