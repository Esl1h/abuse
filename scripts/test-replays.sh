# nor whether the process hung or died behind a crash dialog. The healthy
# run takes about fifty seconds in total there, so a single invocation that
# passes two minutes is stuck, not slow.

# is missing, which is macOS without coreutils, the run is unbounded exactly
# as before: the bound is a diagnostic, not a requirement.
