# Building Abuse

## Prerequists

### All Platforms

- SDL3 3.2 or later <http://www.libsdl.org/> (note that SDL 1 or 2 will not work)
- [SDL3_mixer 3.0 or later](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
- [CMake 3.21 or later](http://www.cmake.org/)
- GL libraries and headers are required for OpenGL support.

#### CPM

With SDL3/SDL3_mixer, it's now possible to use [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/cpm.cmake) to grab the SDL libraries. This will build them locally. To use externally built libraries (such as those included with a Linux distro), it will be necessary to configure CPM to use those rather than fetch its own copies. One simple way to do this is by setting [`CPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES`](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/cpm.cmake#cpm_use_local_packages). `CPM_LOCAL_PACKAGES_ONLY` will prevent remote packages from being installed entirely.

#### Directory Structure

It's best to have a root directory within which this source code exists, along with additional directories to place the game data (either the open source game data or the closed source game data if you have a valid Abuse license), build directrory, and installer files in. For example, on Windows, you might have a folder structure that looks something like:

 - `Abuse` - the root directory
     - `abuse` - cloned version of this repository
     - `build` - build directory created for CMake
     - `install` - a local directory to contain the final "installed" copy

### Windows with Visual Studio

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- CMake 3.16 or later
- [WiX toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) Optional, required to create an installer

Building in Windows via the command line involves using the Visual Studio developer environment. Visual Studio should have installed a shortcut named "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019" (or whatever version used - the latest is recommended) - this runs a CMD file that sets the necessary environment variables to use the Visual Studio command line tools. Commands need to be run within this environment for CMake to locate Visual Studio and for the development tools to be available.

CMake and WiX can both be installed individually or via the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/). Via Chocolatey, the command to install CMake and the WiX toolset is simply:

    choco install cmake wixtoolset

SDL3 and SDL3_mixer are automatically downloaded and built via CPM (C++ Package Manager) during the CMake configuration step. The `vcpkg.json` file in the repository is a legacy artifact from the previous SDL2 build system and is not used by the current build.

To use libraries already installed on your system instead of building them from source, configure CMake with `-DCPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES=ON`. This is useful to speed up the build and avoid needing all the dependencies required to build SDL3 from source.

With these dependencies resolved, the CMake generation should succeed without any error.

### macOS

macOS should have most of the stuff you need already assuming you have XCode installed. The easiest method for getting CMake is probably using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

    brew install cmake

By default, CMake on macOS uses the Makefile generator. To use the Xcode generator (which makes debugging with Xcode easier), specific `-G Xcode` when running CMake.

SDL3/SDL3_mixer are now downloaded as subprojects and are built into the generated macOS bundle. This makes distributing the macOS binary much simpler as it no longer requires the user have SDL installed in some fashion.

### Linux

Linux builds use CMake presets defined in `CMakePresets.json` for convenience:

| Preset | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | RelWithDebInfo | Development with `-Wall -Wextra`, tests enabled, optimizations for fast builds (ccache, mold linker) |
| `release` | Release | Optimized build for distribution |
| `asan` | Debug | AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, with the alignment and null checks turned off (the 1995 loaders read structs straight from file data) |
| `headless` | RelWithDebInfo | CI builds: MIDI and FluidSynth off, no ccache or mold, so the host needs fewer dependencies |

All presets inherit from `linux-base`, which sets `CPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES=ON`. This tells CPM to prefer libraries already installed on the system (such as SDL3) rather than downloading and compiling them from source. Without this setting, the build requires all the dependencies needed to build SDL3 from source, including X11 development headers.

`SDL3_mixer` and `SDL3_native_midi` are fetched and built by CPM regardless of that setting, because no distribution packages them yet. Only SDL3 itself is picked up from the system.

To use a preset:

```sh
cmake --preset dev && cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
```

The compiled binary is located at `build/<preset>/src/abuse`.

#### Native MIDI on Linux

Building with native MIDI support (`ABUSE_ENABLE_NATIVE_MIDI=ON`, the default) requires ALSA development headers:

- **Fedora/RHEL**: `sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel`
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install libasound2-dev`

If these headers are not available, native MIDI can be disabled with `-DABUSE_ENABLE_NATIVE_MIDI=OFF`.

# Compiling

1. Clone this repository.

       git clone https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse.git

2. Create a new directory for the build. CMake likes to build into directories
   outside the source directory and it's best not to fight it on this.

   Within that directory, run CMake.

   In order to get a build that includes all the data, you'll want to specify
   an install directory. All told, you might setup doing something like:

    ```sh
    mkdir abuse
    cd abuse
    git clone https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse.git
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake --install-prefix $(cd ../install; pwd) ../abuse
    ```

   On macOS, you may wish to use the Xcode generator:

   ```sh
   cmake -G Xcode --install-prefix $(cd ../install; pwd) ../abuse
   ```

   On Windows, you can use a standard CMake command:

    ```bat
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=../install ../abuse
    ```

   If you have SDL3 libraries already installed on your system and wish to use them instead of having CMake download and build them, add `-DCPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES=ON` to the command above.

3. Build the files:

   Under Linux, this is the familiar `make`.

   macOS builds through Xcode, so either open the `abuse.xcodeproj` in Xcode, or build it via the command line using `xcodebuild -project abuse.xcodeproj`. Targets are specified via the `-target` command line option to `xcodebuild`. Configurations in macOS are case-sensitive and can be set via `-configuration`, i.e., `-configuration Debug` or `-configuration Release`.

   Under Windows, the build is done through Visual Studio, so either open `abuse.sln` in Visual Studio, or build via the command line using `MSBuild abuse.sln`. Unlike Linux and macOS, individual targets are `.vcxproj` files. `ALL_BUILD.vcxproj` is the default build target, and the other `.vcxproj` files are the other build targets.

4. Install the files:

   Note that you can skip this step if you're planning on building an installer. For Linux, this is simply `make install`. On macOS, it's the more verbose `xcodebuild -project abuse.xcodeproj -target install`. On Windows, build `INSTALL.vcxproj` with either `MSBuild` or inside Visual Studio.

# Installers (Packages)

The CMake package includes some CPack stuff to enable building installers. Under
Windows, this will attempt to create a [WIX](http://wixtoolset.org/) installer
and a ZIP file. Under macOS, it attempts to create a DMG and TGZ.

To build them under Linux, it's just `make package`.

For macOS, `xcodebuild -project abuse.xcodeproj -target package`.

Under Windows, build `PROJECT.vcxproj`.

# Quickstart

These provide a basic list of commands to check out and build for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Quickstart: Linux

```sh
mkdir abuse
cd abuse
git clone https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=../install ../abuse
make
make install
../install/abuse
```

## Quickstart: macOS

```sh
mkdir abuse
cd abuse
git clone https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Xcode -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=../install ../abuse
xcodebuild -project abuse.xcodeproj
xcodebuild -project abuse.xcodeproj -target install
../install/abuse.app/Contents/MacOS/abuse
```

## Quickstart: Windows

Note that you'll need to use one of the shortcuts Visual Studio provides with the dev environment variables set to use this, otherwise, MSBuild won't work.

```bat
md abuse
cd abuse
git clone https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse.git
md build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=..\install ..\abuse
MSBuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
MSBuild INSTALL.vcxproj
..\install\abuse
```
