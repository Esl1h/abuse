// playback, a recording, or an input script.
//
// Not the same question as headless(). A scripted run can have a real
// window, which is the only way to exercise the GPU path, and it still must
// not read the machine it runs on: the gamepad is the one that bit.
// SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_DOWN arrives as a key press, any key press stops
// a demo playback (src/demo.cpp), and a pad on the desk therefore ended runs
// at a different tick every time. Five of eight, measured.
bool scripted_run();

// Narrower: the input itself comes from somewhere that is not a person.
//
// Recording is the difference. A recording run *is* a person playing, and
// the whole point of it is to capture what they do, gamepad included; it
// is only a scripted run in the sense that the harness is watching. Every
// other use of scripted_run() wants both.
bool input_is_scripted();

// True under --save-dialog, which opens the save picker on purpose to draw
// it. It is the one caller allowed past the guard in load_game, and it
// queues an Esc first so the picker has something to read.

// ticks, which is the only way a scripted capture can show it: the harness
// runs one frame per tick, where there is nothing to blend.

// --save-dialog: opens the save-slot picker, the thing that stands between
// pressing down at a save console and a file being written, and closes it
// with Esc. Prints what it returned.
//
// The picker is where the Windows crash has to be: writing the file itself
// is covered by --save-test and passes there. It builds thumbnails from
// whatever saves exist, makes a window out of icon art, and runs its own
// event loop, and none of that had ever been exercised by a test.

// --save-test: saves the game at the end of the run, the way the save
// console does, and says on stdout whether the file was written and how big
// it is. The point is the path and the writing, not the contents.
//
// Saving crashed on Windows the first time a person tried it, on a machine
// none of us can debug, and nothing in the suite had ever written a save
// file. This is how that gets exercised on every platform CI builds for.

// --viewport W H: the size of the buffer the game draws into, which is

// like before deciding anything, and the engine has refused -size outside
// the editor since 1995.
